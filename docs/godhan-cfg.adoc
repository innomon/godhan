= Go Dhan: Configurator

A simple AsciiDoc inspired configuration file. Of the following syntax:

At start of line, a `.` followed by non case sensitive, `Init` followed by a space, then a string without spaces.

Thereafter, a parameter block follows, delimited by a non empty line should have four or more hyphens, `-` , and closed by same number of `-`.

The parameter string, enclosed between the initialization block is passed to the initializer as is. Thus, any format, including JSON, XML, CSV and any combination thereof.

----
.Init FunctionName
-----
{"hello", "some config" }

<func-name>This mixed style, JSON and XML, is unlikely to be used by a developer, but allowed. </func-name>
-----
----

The idea behind this design is that an asciidoc formatted configuration file can be passed to the Configuartion Manager. Thus a configuration file can support various formats as well as can be well documented.
