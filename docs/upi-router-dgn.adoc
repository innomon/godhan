.Section 4.3.2 Payment API of UNIFIED PAYMENT INTERFACE â€“ VERSION 1.2, Feb 2016, Pg 30/107

"The PSPs maintain the PSP specific payment addresses which can be resolved to any of the common global addresses (Aadhaar
number, Mobile number, Account + Provider ID) that NPCI can understand"

Thus a routing table is needed for mapping `xpath` expression to the Server, Protocol, MMID + Mobile number.

.Configure Router(param1, "p2")

xpath: */xyz/@path
